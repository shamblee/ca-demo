- dark color palette
- neutral backgrounds and borders

- pill-shaped buttons

## Custom Color Palette
``` css
:root{
    --blue: #4583F7;
    --purple: #8E59FF;
}
```

Brand color: #4583F7 (--blue)
Secondary color: #8E59FF (--purple)


## Rules
Use the brand color sparingly. The brand color should only be used for interactive elements, like buttons, links, clickable icons, etc.
The brand color can be used as a thin border color in situations where an element should be highlighted
but is not a main CTA.
The secondary color should be used to highlight important information that is not interactive. Secondary color can also be used as a accent color.
Brand and secondary colors can also be used with transparency to create color shades
