## User Roles and Access

- App roles
  - guest: view-only permissions
  - default: standard account member; can edit content and configure agents
  - manager: default permissions plus can add/remove users
  - admin: all permissions; can change roles, manage billing, delete account

- Database roles (UserRole enum)
  - admin, standard, guest
  - Mapping guidance
    - guest (app) → guest (db)
    - default (app) → standard (db)
    - manager (app) → standard (db) plus manager capabilities handled by application logic/permissions checks
    - admin (app) → admin (db)

## Core Concepts and Relationships

- Profiles: stored customer contact records
- Enrichment: appends additional properties/attributes to profiles; creates Segments
- Segments: subsets of profiles based on demographics and/or event history
- Messages: imported content from GardenIQ; includes email, SMS, and push notification variants for a given subject
- Message categories: folders/content libraries that agents draw from
- Channels: the medium used for sending (email, SMS, push notification)
- AI decisioning agents: select message, channel, send day/time, and execute sends to profiles
- Agent settings: send frequency, time windows, desired outcomes, holdout percentage
- Outcomes: ranked as Worst, Good, Very Good, Best; events map to rankings
- Holdout percentage: portion of the segment excluded from agent sends for testing/control

## Global Navigation

- Left side pane navigation:
  - Home → Dashboard (/dashboard)
  - Profiles (/profiles)
  - Segments (/segments)
  - Messages (/messages)
  - Decisioning (/decisioning)
  - Settings → Account (/account)

## Main Layout

- Header bar with app logo (left) and user avatar (right)
  - Clicking the logo → Dashboard
  - Clicking the avatar → Profile (/profile)
- Two-column responsive content area (approx. 80:20)
  - Left: primary content
  - Right: optional secondary content (right rail)
  - Right rail can be hidden to allow full-width primary content

## Styling Guidelines

- Framework: Tailwind CSS (v4)
- Look and Feel
  - Modern, professional, dark palette
  - Neutral backgrounds and borders
  - Rounded corners; pill-shaped buttons
- Color palette
  - Brand: #4583F7 (var(--blue))
  - Secondary: #8E59FF (var(--purple))
- Usage rules
  - Use brand color sparingly for interactive elements (buttons, links, clickable icons)
  - Use thin brand-colored borders to highlight non-CTA elements when needed
  - Use secondary color to highlight non-interactive important information or as an accent
  - Both colors may be used with transparency for subtle shading and states

- Messaging: sends, opens, clicks, bounces, new subscribers, unsubscribers across all channels
- Ecommerce: add-to-cart, favorites/saves, initiated checkout, abandoned checkout, purchases
- Attribution and ROI
  - Revenue, orders, AOV attributed to messages and agents
  - Users can select messages or agents to analyze and compare

## Tech Stack and Architecture

- React, Next.js (pages directory), Tailwind CSS v4, lucide-react, Supabase, Zod, RxJS, uuid
- Static Site Generation (SSG) only; no server-side rendering (SSR)
- Pages live in /pages; do not use the Next.js App Router
- Exports: use named exports unless Next.js pages require default export
- Icons: lucide-react
- Forms: typed useState and Zod schemas for validation when persisting to DB

## Multi-Tenancy and Data

- Tenancy model
  - account table represents a tenant
  - All tenant-bound entities include account_id
  - Users link to accounts via account_membership
- Required base entities
  - User (id, created_at, name, email, profile_image_path?, hero_image_path?)
  - Account (id, created_at, name, logo_image_path?, hero_image_path?)
  - AccountMembership (id, created_at, last_accessed_at, user_id, account_id, role: user_role)
  - UserRole enum: admin, standard, guest
- Domain entities (conceptual)
  - Profile, Segment, Message, MessageCategory, Agent, AgentDecision, OutcomeMapping, ChannelSubscription
  - Ensure each has account_id for scoping
- File storage
  - Supabase Storage bucket: accounts
  - Path pattern: {account_id}/users/{user_id}/{REST_OF_PATH}
  - Store only the path in DB; resolve full URLs client-side with fileStore() or useFileUrl
- CRUD and data access
  - store() service and useStore*() hooks for reactive CRUD and querying
  - SelectOptions for pagination and ordering

## Layout and Page Conventions

- Main layout
  - Navigation bar and centered column content by default
  - Two-column content area with optional right rail
- Display modes
  - useFullPage() to hide main navigation and present a full-screen experience
  - useNoMargins() to remove margins and allow edge-to-edge designs
  - useIsInFullPageMode() and useIsNoMarginMode() to read current display state
- Pages
  - Next.js pages must export a default function named after the page
  - Root element className must follow: page--{PageComponentName}
  - Do not wrap pages with MainLayout directly; the App component handles it

## Authentication and Registration

- Authentication
  - Sign-in with email/password
  - If a user visits protected pages without being signed in, show SignInRequired
- Registration
  - When registering, store the user’s name and account name in options.data:
    - { name, accountName }
  - Do not insert DB rows explicitly during signup; backend handles user and account setup
- Invites
  - Accept via /accept-account-invite/[invite-code]
  - If not signed in, prompt to sign in first

## Permissions and Security

- Role-based access
  - Admin: full control, can edit account info, manage roles (except cannot change own role), billing, delete account
  - Manager: can add/remove users (handled by app logic), inherits standard permissions
  - Default/Standard: can edit content and configure agents
  - Guest: view-only
- Data isolation
  - All queries and mutations constrained by account_id

## Standard Components

- Logo
  - SVG logo, customizable color and size
  - import { Logo } from "@/components/Logo";
- SignInRequired
  - Card for access-restricted scenarios with sign-in/register links
  - import { SignInRequired } from "@/components/SignInRequired";

## Supabase, Hooks, and Utilities

- Supabase client
  - supClient() for auth and data operations
- Store service and hooks
  - store().select*/insert/update/delete
  - useStoreItem(), useStoreMatchingItems(), useStoreFirstMatchingItem()
- File utilities
  - fileStore().getUrlAsync(path), getCachedUrl(path)
  - useFileUrl(path)
- User/account hooks
  - useCurrentUser(), useAccount(), useUserRole(), useUserInfo()
- App controller
  - app().switchAccountAsync(accountId) to change active tenant
- Utilities
  - cn(...) to combine class names

## Interaction and UI Patterns

- Buttons and CTAs
  - Pill-shaped, no static widths, use brand color for primary interactions
- Links and icons
  - Use brand color sparingly; lucide-react icons for clarity with minimal visual noise
- States and emphasis
  - Secondary color used for non-interactive emphasis; transparent tints for subtle backgrounds and borders
- Thumbnails and lists
  - Compact grid cards with rounded corners, neutral borders, and clear hover states
- Modals and popovers
  - For rename, move, duplicate, and delete actions within message categories

## Glossary

- Profile: A customer record with contact info, attributes, and events
- Segment: A subset of profiles based on shared demographics or behavior
- Message: A marketing communication with variants (email, SMS, push)
- Category: A folder that organizes messages
- Agent: An automated decisioning entity that selects message, channel, and send timing
- Outcome: Event-to-ranking mapping guiding agent optimization
- Holdout: Percentage of a segment withheld from agent sends for control and measurement

<coding-rules>
## Tech Stack
- ReactJS
- NextJS - pages directory and static site generation
- Tailwinds v4
- lucide-react - icons
- Supabase

## Layout
It is preferred to use stacking layouts using flex-box columns to avoid running out of horizontal
room. Avoid long names in buttons and prefer to use icons for buttons.

If buttons display text DO NOT give the button a static width.

## Static site generation
The frontend of the app uses static site generation so no server side rendering should be used. All
pages are stored in the pages directory and the NextJS app router is NOT used.

## Exports
Always use named exports unless explicitly told otherwise or required such as when creating NextJS
pages.

## Multi-tenet Database
The database is a multi-tenet database where the `account` table represents each tenet. All entities
that belong to or fall under an account should have an `account_id` property directly linking the
entity to an account. Entities that can belong to multiple accounts should use a join table to
link to an account. 

The `user` table is linked to the `account` table through the `account_membership` table.


## Required Entities
The following entities must be represented in the database schema. Additional properties or values
can be added to the entities

### User
Represents a signed-in user

Table name: user
Required Properties:
- id: uuid
- created_at: timestamptz
- name: text
- email: text
- profile_image_path?: text - path of profile picture in the accounts bucket
- hero_image_path?: text

### Account
Represents a company or organization

Table name: account
Required Properties:
- id: uuid
- created_at: timestamptz
- name: text
- logo_image_path?: text - path of profile picture in the accounts bucket
- hero_image_path?: text

### AccountMembership
Links a User to an Account

Table name: account_membership
Required Properties:
- id: uuid
- created_at: timestamptz
- last_accessed_at: timestamptz
- user_id: uuid
- account_id: uuid
- role: UserRole

### UserRole
An enumeration of different role types.
- admin: The admin of an account
- standard: The default role of a user
- guest: A guest in an account
Enum name: user_role



## Schema Utility Types
The `@/lib/schema` import contains types and objects that map to the database schema.

`@/lib/schema` exports the following:
- typeDefs: An object of type `Record<string,TypeDef>` containing key value pairs for each table in the database.
- {type_name}: An interface that represents the structure of a value in a table.
- {type_name}_insert: An interface that represents the structure of a value to be inserted in the a table.
- {type_name}Schema: A Zod schema that represents the structure of a value in a table.
- {type_name}_insertSchema: A Zod schema that represents the structure of a value to be inserted in the a table.
- TypeDef: An interface that represents a type
- PropDef: An interface the represents a property of a type
- TypeMapping: An interface that maps type names to various programming languages.


Example:
``` ts
import { User, User_insert, UserSchema, User_insertSchema, typeDefs } from "@/lib/schema";

let user:User;
UserSchema.parse(user);

let newUser:User_insert;
User_insertSchema.parse(newUser);

const userPrimaryKey=typeDefs.primaryKey;
```

Schema Utility Interfaces:
``` ts
export interface TypeMapping
{
    name:string;
    ts?:string;
    zod?:string;
    convo?:string;
    sql?:string;
}

export interface PropDef
{
    name:string;
    type:TypeMapping;
    primary?:boolean;
    description?:string;
    sqlDef?:string;
    optional?:boolean;
    hasDefault?:boolean;
    isArray?:boolean;
    arrayDimensions?:number;
}

export interface TypeDef<
    TValue extends Record<string,any>=Record<string,any>,
    TInsert extends Record<string,any>=Record<string,any>
\>{


    name:string;
    description?:string;
    type:'type'|'enum';
    primaryKey:(keyof TValue) & (keyof TInsert);
    sqlTable?:string;
    sqlSchema?:string;
    zodSchema?:ZodType;
    zodInsertSchema?:ZodType;
    props:PropDef[];
}
```

## Supabase client
The `supClient` function imported from "@/lib/supabase" can be used to access an instance of a
Supabase client.

Supabase Client Example:
``` ts
import { supClient } from "@/lib/supabase";

async function signInExampleAsync(){
    const signInResult=await supClient().auth.signInWithPassword({email,password});
}
```

## File Storage
File should be stored using supabase storage using the `accounts` bucket and use the following pattern for paths.

File path pattern: `{account_id}/users/{user_id}/{REST_OF_PATH}`

Example file path for:
- account_id: 809f36d5-8549-417e-b89c-7f1cb129b4dc
- user_id: fe691ceb-ba31-421e-9a51-7fb1207965e8
- file_name: example-book.pdf

Upload Path: `809f36d5-8549-417e-b89c-7f1cb129b4dc/users/fe691ceb-ba31-421e-9a51-7fb1207965e8/example-book.pdf`

### Storing file path in Database
When storing file paths in the database only path of uploaded files should be store, the full URL
will be generated client side using either the `fileStore()` service imported from `@/lib/fileStore`
or using the `useFileUrl` hook imported from `@/lib/hooks`.

Example of getting full URL for user profile picture using the `fileStore()` service:
``` ts
import { fileStore } from "@/lib/fileStore";
import { User } from "@/lib/schema";

async function exampleFunction(user:User){
    if(!user.profile_image_path){
        return;
    }
    const profilePictureUrl=await fileStore().getUrlAsync(user.profile_image_path);
}
```

Example of getting full URL for user profile picture using the `useFileUrl` hook:
``` tsx
import { useFileUrl } from "@/lib/hooks";
import { User } from "@/lib/schema";

function ExampleComponent({user}:{user:User}){
    const profilePictureUrl=useFileUrl(user.profile_image_path);
    return (
        <div>
            {profilePictureUrl===null?
                'loading'
            :profilePictureUrl===undefined
                'No profile picture'
            :
                <img src={profilePictureUrl}/>
            }
        </div>
    )
}
```

fileStore API:
``` ts
/**
 * Utility class for Supabase storage operations. By default the FileStore class uses the `accounts`
 * bucket.
 */
export class FileStore
{
    /**
     * Gets the full URL for a given path. When needed signed URLs will be created. The result of the
     * function will be cached and future calls for the same path will returned immediately
     */
    public async getUrlAsync(path:string):Promise<string|undefined>;

    /**
     * Attempts to get the cached URL for the path. If a URL has not been cached for the path
     * undefined will be returned.
     */
    public getCachedUrl(path:string):string|undefined;
}
```

useFileUrl API
``` ts
/**
 * Gets the full URL to a given path
 * Return values:
 * null: URL info is being loaded
 * undefined: URL not available
 * {string}: The full URL of the path
 * @param path The path to get a URL for. If null or undefined then undefined is returned.
 */
export const useFileUrl=(path:string|null|undefined):string|null|undefined=>;
```



## CRUD
Common CRUD operations can be handled using the `store()` service imported from `@/lib/store`
or the `useStore*()` React hooks imported from `@/lib/hooks`.

Store service example:
``` ts
import { store } from "@/lib/store";
import { typeDefs } from "@/lib/schema";

const user=await store().selectFirstMatchesAsync(typeDefs.User,{email:'example@example.com'})
```

Use store hook example:
``` ts
import { useFirstMatchingStoreItem } from "@/lib/hooks";
import { typeDefs } from "@/lib/schema";

function ExampleComponent()
{
    const user=useFirstMatchingStoreItem(typeDefs.User,{email:'example@example.com'});
}
```

### Store service API

``` ts

export class Store
{

    /**
     * Gets an item from a table by table name and id. Undefined is returned if no item exists
     * in the table with the given id.
     * @param table Name of table to get item from
     * @param id Id of item to get
     */
    public async selectFirstAsync<T extends Record<string,any>>(table:string|TypeDef<T>,id:string):Promise<T|undefined>;

    /**
     * Selects all matching items from the given table
     * @param table Name of table to select from
     * @param match An object with properties to match against
     * @param options Options used to control selection
     */
    public async selectMatchesAsync<T extends Record<string,any>>(table:string|TypeDef<T>,match:Partial<T>,options?:SelectOptions):Promise<Record<string,any>[]>;

    /**
     * Selects the first matching item form the given table
     * @param table Table to select from
     * @param match An object with properties to match against
     */
    public async selectFirstMatchesAsync<T extends Record<string,any>>(table:string|TypeDef<T>,match:Partial<T>):Promise<Record<string,any>|undefined>;

    /**
     * Updates an item value in a table by id.
     * @param table Name of table to set the item in.
     * @param id Id of the item to set
     * @param value Value of the item to set
     * @returns The value passed to the setItem function
     */
    public async insertAsync<T extends Record<string,any>>(table:string|TypeDef<Record<string,any>,T>,value:T):Promise<T>;
    
    /**
     * Updates an item value in a table by id.
     * @param table Name of table to set the item in.
     * @param id Id of the item to set
     * @param value Value of the item to set
     * @returns The value passed to the setItem function
     */
    public async updateAsync<T extends Record<string,any>>(table:string|TypeDef<T>,id:string,value:Partial<T>):Promise<T>;
    
    /**
     * Deletes an item from a table
     * @param table The name of the table to delete the item from
     * @param id The Id of the item to delete
     * @returns The value of the item before being delete or undefined
     */
    public async deleteAsync<T extends Record<string,any>>(table:string|TypeDef<T>,id:string):Promise<T|undefined>;
}
```

### Store hooks
The store hooks also have the added benefit of automatically receiving updates when changes are made
by the `store()` service.

``` ts

export interface UseStoreItemOptions
{
    /**
     * If true useStoreItem will return undefined
     */
    disabled?:boolean;

    /**
     * If true the value will be reset to null when disabled. By default the last loaded
     * value will be returned when disabled.
     */
    resetOnDisabled?:boolean;

    /**
     * If true the value will be reset to null when table or id changes. By default the last loaded
     * value will be returned until the new value is loaded.
     */
    resetOnChange?:boolean;
}

```

## Full screen screens
The `useFullPage` hook can be used to display a full screen page without the main navigation bar.

example:
``` tsx
import { useFullPage } from "@/lib/hooks";

function ExampleComponent(){

    useFullPage();

    return (
        <div></div>
    )
}
```

## Form Data
When creating forms store form data in a typed useState variable.

Zod schemas can be imported from `@/lib/schema` to validate types stored in the database.

Form state example:
``` tsx

interface NewsletterForm
{
    name:string
    email:string;
}
function ExampleComponent()
{
    const [newsletterData,setNewsletterData]=useState<NewsletterForm>({
        name:'',
        email:'',
    });

    return (
        <form>
            <input
                placeholder="Enter name"
                value={newsletterData.name}
                onChange={e=>setNewsletterData({...newsletterData,name:e.target.value})}
            />
            <input
                placeholder="Enter email"
                value={newsletterData.email}
                onChange={e=>setNewsletterData({...newsletterData,email:e.target.value})}
            />
        </form>
    )
}
```

## Pages
When creating NextJS pages export the page component as a default function with the function
name reflecting the name of the page.

Do not use the MainLayout component when creating a page. The Main Layout component will be
used by the top level App component.

Include the name of the page in the className of the root element of the page component using the
format of: "page--{PageComponentName}"

Example Page with a route of "/example":
``` tsx

export default function ExamplePage(){

    return (
        <div className="page--ExamplePage">
            Example page content
        <div>
    )
}
```

## Main Layout
The `MainLayout` component is used by the top level `App` component to render the main layout of the
app. By default the MainLayout should render pages in a centered column with a navigation bar.

### Main Layout Display modes
Pages can use the `useFullPage` and `useNoMargins` hooks to alter the way the page is displayed.
Implement display modes using css or class names, DO NOT change the render order or do anything
that would cause the page to be unmounted.

### Main Layout Fullscreen Mode
Pages can request to enter into fullscreen. Use the `useIsInFullPageMode` hook imported from 
`@/lib/hooks` to check if the page should be displayed in fullscreen mode. If useIsInFullPageMode
returns true hide the main navigation and any other UI other than the page content.

### Main Layout No Margins Mode
Pages can request to remove all page margins so that they can display content edge to edge. Use
the `useIsNoMarginMode` hook imported from `@/lib/hooks` to check if the page should be displayed
in no margins mode.


## Packages
This is the package.json file for the project. You can only use libraries based on the dependencies
of the package.json file.

``` json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lucide-react": "^0.544.0",
    "markdown-it": "^14.1.0",
    "next": "15.5.4",
    "react": "19.1.0",
    "react-dom": "19.1.0",
    "rxjs": "^7.8.2",
    "uuid": "^13.0.0",
    "zod": "^4.1.11",
    "supabase": "^2.33.9",
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^19",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19",
    "tailwindcss": "^4",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}


```

## Standard Components
The following components can be used

### Logo
Displays the apps logo using an SVG

Import: `import { Logo } from "@/components/Logo";`
Props:
``` ts
interface LogoProps
{
    color?:string;
    /**
     * @default "w-8 h-8"
     */ 
    className?:string;
    size?:string|number;
}
```

### SignInRequired
A card to display when a user does not have access to a screen with links to sign-in or register.
Import: `import { Logo } from "@/components/SignInRequired";`
Props:
``` ts
interface SignInRequiredProps
{

    /**
     * A message to display to the user
     */
    message?:string;
    className?:string;
}
```


## User Registration

When registering a new user store the user's name and account name in options.data object
of the user sign-up options:
``` ts
await supClient().auth.signUp({
    email: form.email.trim(),
    password: form.password,
    options: {
        data: { name: form.name, accountName:form.accountName },
    },
});
```

When registering a new user do not explicitly insert any values into the database.
User and account setup will be handled by the backend.


## Utility Functions
The following utility functions can be imported from `@/lib/util`

``` ts
export type ClassNameValue = string | false | number | null | undefined | {
    [className: string]: any;
} | ClassNameValue[];

/**
 * Combines class names and ignores falsy values.
 */
export const cn=(...classNames:ClassNameValue[]):string=>;
```


## Hooks
React components can use the following hooks imported from `@/lib/hooks`

``` ts
/**
 * Hides common UI controls such as the main nav bar.
 * @param enabled If false the hook is disabled
 */
export const useFullPage=(enabled=true)=>;

/**
 * Removes all margins and paddings from the main layout while keeping the main navigation and
 * other shared UI elements
 * @param enabled If false the hook is disabled
 */
export const useNoMargins=(enabled=true)=>;

/**
 * Returns true if the page should be displayed in full screen
 */
export const useIsInFullPageMode=():boolean=>{
    const count=useSubject(fullPageSubject);
    return count>0;
}

/**
 * Returns true if the page should remove all margins
 */
export const useIsNoMarginMode=():boolean=>;

/**
 * Returns the current signed-in user.
 * null === user is being loaded
 * undefined === user is not signed in
 */
export const useCurrentUser=():User|null|undefined=>;

/**
 * Returns the current account the user is signed into.
 * null === account is being loaded
 * undefined === No account found for user
 */
export const useAccount=():Account|null|undefined=>;

/**
 * Returns the role of the user in the current account.
 * null === role is being loaded
 * undefined === No role found for user
 */
export const useUserRole=():UserRole|null|undefined=>;

/**
 * Returns the information about the current user, including a user object, account object
 * and the role the user has for the account.
 * null === user info is being loaded
 * undefined === user is not signed in
 */
export const useUserInfo=():UserInfo|null|undefined=>;
```

## Utility types
The following utility types can be imported from `@/lib/types-util`

``` ts
export interface UserInfo
{
    user:User;
    role?:UserRole;
    membership?:AccountMembership;
    account?:Account;
}

/**
 * Options used with select queries
 */
export interface SelectOptions
{
    offset?:number;
    limit?:number;
    orderBy?:string;
    /**
     * If true return items will be ordered in descending order
     */
    orderByDesc?:boolean;
}
```

## App Controller
The App Controller can be accessed by calling the `app` function imported from `@/lib/app`.

Use can use the App Controller to switch between accounts
``` ts
import { app } from `@/lib/app`

async function switchAccountExample(accountId:string){
    await app().switchAccountAsync(accountId);
}
```

## Styling Framework
Use Tailwinds for styling

## Look and Feel
- modern platform design
- professional
- dark color palette
- neutral backgrounds and borders
- rounded corners
- pill-shaped buttons

## Custom Color Palette
``` css
:root{
    --blue: #4583F7;
    --purple: #8E59FF;
}
```

Brand color: #4583F7 (--blue)
Secondary color: #8E59FF (--purple)


## Rules
Use the brand color sparingly. The brand color should only be used for interactive elements, like buttons, links, clickable icons, etc.
The brand color can be used as a thin border color in situations where an element should be highlighted
but is not a main CTA.
The secondary color should be used to highlight important information that is not interactive. Secondary color can also be used as a accent color.
Brand and secondary colors can also be used with transparency to create color shades

# Decisioning Demo Style Guide

A practical guide for using the Tailwind v4-based theme and utilities included in tailwind-theme. This covers layout, components, state patterns, and best practices for brand usage across the app.

## Basics and Setup

- Tailwind version: v4 (utility-first; no App Router; pages dir only)
- Use component classes and utilities defined by the theme before adding one-off Tailwind utilities
- Brand color is reserved for interactive elements; secondary color is for non-interactive emphasis
- Pill-shaped buttons; rounded corners; neutral surfaces and borders for the dark palette

Top of globals.css must begin with:
```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300..900&family=Public+Sans:wght@300..800&display=swap");
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
```

Theme and utilities are defined in tailwind-theme. Do not edit pseudo selectors in @utility; use @layer components for pseudo selectors as already implemented.

## Design Tokens and Color Usage

- Use prebuilt classes like btn-primary, badge.brand, link, highlight for branded accents
- For non-interactive emphasis (info), use secondary color via alert.info, badge.accent, or prose links
- Subtle brand emphasis: highlight (thin brand border) and border-brand-subtle

Dos
- Use brand color for CTAs: buttons, links, clickable icons
- Use secondary for non-clickable highlights and informational emphasis
- Prefer card, tile, and neutral surfaces for layout structure

Don’ts
- Don’t use brand color for large backgrounds
- Don’t apply brand color to non-interactive blocks unless highlighting with thin border

## Page and Layout Conventions

- Root element className must follow: page--{PageComponentName}
- Default centered layout is handled by MainLayout; pages should not import it directly
- Use content-2col to render a two-column layout with a right rail
- Add rail-hidden to collapse to one column

Example: Page root and 2-column layout
```html
<div class="page--Dashboard">
    <header class="app-header">
        <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
            <!-- <Logo/> -->
            <span class="font-bold">Decisioning Demo</span>
        </div>
        <button class="btn btn-secondary btn-icon" aria-label="Profile">
            <!-- avatar or icon -->
        </button>
    </header>

    <main class="container-page space-y-4">
        <section class="content-2col">
            <!-- Primary column -->
            <div class="space-y-3">
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-header">
                        <div class="card-title">Overview</div>
                        <div class="card-subtitle">Summary of performance and trends</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-[var(--text-2)]">Welcome back!</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Right rail -->
            <aside class="right-rail space-y-3">
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-title">Quick Actions</div>
                    <div class="mt-2 flex flex-wrap gap-2">
                        <button class="btn btn-primary">New Agent</button>
                        <button class="btn btn-secondary">Import Profiles</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </aside>
        </section>
    </main>
</div>
```

Collapse right rail
```html
<section class="content-2col rail-hidden">
    <div>Full-width primary content</div>
</section>
```

## App Shell and Navigation

- Use app-shell to split sidebar and content columns
- Use navlink and navlink.active for routing links

```html
<div class="app-shell">
    <aside class="app-sidebar">
        <nav class="flex flex-col gap-1">
            <a class="navlink active" href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
            <a class="navlink" href="/profiles">Profiles</a>
            <a class="navlink" href="/segments">Segments</a>
            <a class="navlink" href="/messages">Messages</a>
            <a class="navlink" href="/decisioning">Decisioning</a>
            <a class="navlink" href="/account">Settings</a>
        </nav>
    </aside>

    <div>
        <header class="app-header">
            <a class="flex items-center gap-2 no-underline" href="/dashboard">
                <!-- <Logo/> -->
                <span class="font-bold">Decisioning Demo</span>
            </a>
            <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-icon" href="/profile" aria-label="Profile">
                <!-- icon/avatar -->
            </a>
        </header>

        <main class="page container-page space-y-4">
            <!-- page content -->
        </main>
    </div>
</div>
```

Fullscreen pages should hide the sidebar (handled by the app). The app-shell.fullscreen class is applied by MainLayout when useFullPage is active.

## Cards, Tiles, and Sections

- card, card-header, card-title, card-subtitle, card-footer build elevated sections
- tile variants are used in grid contexts (messages, categories)

```html
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <div class="flex flex-col">
            <div class="card-title">Recent Activity</div>
            <div class="card-subtitle">Latest events from your tenant</div>
        </div>
        <button class="btn btn-secondary">View all</button>
    </div>

    <div class="space-y-2">
        <div class="flex items-center justify-between">
            <span class="text-[var(--text-2)]">Purchase</span>
            <span class="badge success">Success</span>
        </div>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <div class="flex items-center justify-between">
            <span class="text-[var(--text-2)]">Unsubscribe</span>
            <span class="badge danger">Alert</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card-footer">
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary CTA</button>
        <button class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
    </div>
</div>
```

Tile for message thumbnails
```html
<div class="tile">
    <div class="tile-header">
        <div class="font-semibold">Spring Promo</div>
        <button class="btn btn-secondary btn-icon" aria-label="More">
            <!-- ellipsis icon -->
        </button>
    </div>
    <div class="tile-body">Email, SMS, Push</div>
    <div class="tile-meta">
        <span class="subtle">Created 2025-03-24</span>
        <span class="badge brand">12 variants</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Buttons and Links

- btn, btn-primary, btn-secondary, btn-danger
- btn-primary.ghost for non-filled brand buttons
- btn-icon for square icon buttons
- link for inline clickable text; highlight for non-CTA brand outline

```html
<div class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
    <button class="btn btn-primary ghost">Outline</button>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary">Cancel</button>
    <button class="btn btn-danger">Delete</button>
    <button class="btn btn-icon" aria-label="Refresh">
        <!-- icon -->
    </button>
    <a class="link" href="#learn">Learn more</a>
</div>

<div class="mt-3 p-3 highlight rounded-[var(--radius)]">
    Subtle brand-highlighted container (non-CTA)
</div>
```

## Forms and Inputs

- Compose fields with field, label, input/select/textarea, help-text
- Use .invalid on a wrapper to display error styles

```html
<form class="grid gap-3 max-w-xl">
    <div class="field">
        <label class="label">Name</label>
        <input class="input" placeholder="Enter name"/>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
        <label class="label">Email</label>
        <input class="input" placeholder="name@example.com" type="email"/>
        <div class="help-text">We’ll never share your email.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="field invalid">
        <label class="label">Phone</label>
        <input class="input" placeholder="+1 (555) 555-1234"/>
        <div class="help-text">Please provide a valid phone number.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="flex gap-2">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Cancel</button>
    </div>
</form>
```

Checkboxes and radios are styled by base classes. Pair them with labels:
```html
<label class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <input type="checkbox" class="checkbox"/>
    <span class="text-[var(--text-2)]">Subscribe to SMS</span>
</label>
```

## Tabs

- Use tab for base, tab active for selected tab

```html
<div class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <button class="tab active">Email</button>
    <button class="tab">SMS</button>
    <button class="tab">Push</button>
</div>
```

## Tables

- Wrap with table-wrap and use table for the table element

```html
<div class="table-wrap">
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Date added</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="td-base">Jane Doe</td>
            <td class="td-base">jane@example.com</td>
            <td class="td-base">2025-04-02</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="td-base">John Smith</td>
            <td class="td-base">john@example.com</td>
            <td class="td-base">2025-04-05</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
```

## Badges, Chips, Status

- badge with variants: accent, brand, success, warning, danger
- chip for compact labels
- status mirrors badge variants

```html
<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
    <span class="badge">Default</span>
    <span class="badge accent">Info</span>
    <span class="badge brand">Brand</span>
    <span class="badge success">Success</span>
    <span class="badge warning">Warning</span>
    <span class="badge danger">Danger</span>
    <span class="chip">Segment: VIP</span>
    <span class="status success">Active</span>
</div>
```

## Alerts

- Non-interactive informative emphasis; secondary color is appropriate for info

```html
<div class="alert info">
    <div class="font-semibold">Heads up</div>
    <div class="text-[var(--text-2)]">Messages are imported from GardenIQ. Authoring is disabled.</div>
</div>
```

## KPI Blocks

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-4 gap-3 kpi-grid">
    <div class="kpi">
        <div class="kpi-label">Total Orders</div>
        <div class="kpi-value">4,218</div>
        <div class="kpi-delta text-[var(--success)]">+8.3%</div>
    </div>
    <div class="kpi">
        <div class="kpi-label">AOV</div>
        <div class="kpi-value">$86.40</div>
        <div class="kpi-delta text-[var(--text-3)]">–</div>
    </div>

## Dashboard KPI Grid (Page Rule)

The theme provides a page-specific helper for the Dashboard KPI layout via .page--Dashboard .kpi-grid.

```html
<div class="page--Dashboard">
    <main class="container-page">
        <section class="kpi-grid">
            <div class="kpi">
                <div class="kpi-label">Sends</div>
                <div class="kpi-value">186k</div>
                <div class="kpi-delta text-[var(--success)]">+5.4%</div>
            </div>
            <div class="kpi">
                <div class="kpi-label">Opens</div>
                <div class="kpi-value">42k</div>
                <div class="kpi-delta text-[var(--success)]">+2.1%</div>
            </div>
            <div class="kpi">
                <div class="kpi-label">Clicks</div>
                <div class="kpi-value">12.1k</div>
                <div class="kpi-delta text-[var(--success)]">+0.8%</div>
            </div>
            <div class="kpi">
                <div class="kpi-label">Bounces</div>
                <div class="kpi-value">1,042</div>
                <div class="kpi-delta text-[var(--danger)]">+0.3%</div>
            </div>
        </section>
    </main>
</div>
```

## Messages and Categories Grid

- Use .page--Messages .grid or .page--MessageCategory .grid for responsive tiles

```html
<div class="page--Messages">
    <main class="container-page">
        <div class="grid">
            <a class="tile no-underline" href="/message-category?id=welcome">
                <div class="tile-header">
                    <div class="font-semibold">Welcome Series</div>
                    <span class="badge brand">8</span>
                </div>
                <div class="tile-body">Automations</div>
                <div class="tile-meta">
                    <span class="subtle">Updated 2025-04-04</span>
                    <span class="chip">Email + SMS</span>
                </div>
            </a>
            <a class="tile no-underline" href="/message-category?id=promo">
                <div class="tile-header">
                    <div class="font-semibold">Promotions</div>
                    <span class="badge brand">24</span>
                </div>
                <div class="tile-body">Campaign Library</div>
                <div class="tile-meta">
                    <span class="subtle">Updated 2025-03-29</span>
                    <span class="chip">All channels</span>
                </div>
            </a>
        </div>
    </main>
</div>
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- Buttons, inputs, and interactive elements have a consistent focus ring (focus-ring)
- Ensure aria-labels on icon-only buttons (btn-icon)
- Maintain sufficient color contrast; avoid using brand color on large text backgrounds

```html
<button class="btn btn-icon" aria-label="Open menu">
    <!-- icon -->
</button>
<input class="input focus-ring" placeholder="Search"/>
```

## Page Root Naming

- Always include the page root class name using page--{ComponentName}
- Examples: page--Dashboard, page--Profiles, page--Segments, page--Messages, page--Decisioning, page--Account

```html
<div class="page--Profiles">
    <main class="container-page space-y-4">
        <header class="flex items-center justify-between">
            <h1 class="section-title text-xl">Profiles</h1>
            <div class="flex gap-2">
                <button class="btn btn-secondary">Export</button>
                <button class="btn btn-primary">Import CSV</button>
            </div>
        </header>

        <div class="table-wrap">
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Full name</th>
                        <th>Email</th>
                        <th>Phone</th>
                        <th>Device ID</th>
                        <th>Date added</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="td-base">Avery Chen</td>
                        <td class="td-base">avery@example.com</td>
                        <td class="td-base">+1 (555) 555-1000</td>
                        <td class="td-base">device-xyz</td>
                        <td class="td-base">2025-04-05</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
    </main>
</div>
```

## Brand and Secondary Use Examples

Interactive brand (buttons, links)
```html
<a class="link" href="/decisioning">Go to Decisioning</a>
<button class="btn btn-primary">Activate Agent</button>
```

Non-interactive secondary (info emphasis)
```html
<div class="alert info">
    <div class="font-semibold">Note</div>
    <div class="text-[var(--text-2)]">Agents learn from outcomes; configure rankings for best results.</div>
</div>
```

Subtle brand outline (non-CTA)
```html
<div class="p-3 highlight">
    This section is highlighted with a thin brand border.
</div>
```

## Performance and Responsiveness

- Cards and tiles include hover and elevation transitions
- The dashboard KPI grid adapts from 4 to 2 to 1 columns at breakpoints
- Message grids adapt using page-level grid helpers

```html
<div class="page--MessageCategory">
    <main class="container-page">
        <div class="grid">
            <!-- responsive tiles go here -->
        </div>
    </main>
</div>
```

## Practical Tips

- Prefer component classes (btn, card, tile, table, etc.) and theme utilities (container-page, content-2col) before composing many ad-hoc Tailwind classes
- For custom emphasis that isn’t a CTA, use highlight or border-brand-subtle instead of a filled brand background
- Use alert.info for informative notices where secondary color is appropriate
- Use focus-ring for custom focusable elements to maintain consistent accessibility affordances

If you must reference tokens directly in utilities, use CSS variable syntax for color values:
```html
<div class="p-3 rounded-[var(--radius)] border" style="border-color: var(--color-border)">
    <p class="text-[var(--color-text-2)]">Direct token usage example.</p>
</div>
```

This guide should cover most layout and component needs for the app screens:
- Dashboard, Profiles, Segments, Messages, Decisioning, Account/Settings
- Message categories and details
- Agent creation, detail logs, analytics views
- Invite, Register, Sign-in flows using the same input/button patterns

Adhere to the brand usage rules and rely on the provided theme utilities for a consistent, modern, dark UI.

<main-layout>
# Main Layout

Primary application shell used by the top-level App component to frame all pages. It provides a responsive top navigation bar with account switching, a two-column content pattern with an optional right rail, and respects page display modes (fullscreen and no-margins).

Pages must not import MainLayout directly. The App component mounts pages inside MainLayout and passes children.

## Component API

Props
- children: ReactNode (required) — the page content to render inside the layout

Behavior
- Renders the global header (logo, navigation, account switcher, user menu)
- Collapsible navigation on mobile with an expand (hamburger) button
- Applies page display modes:
  - Fullscreen mode hides the header/nav and shows only children
  - No-margins mode removes page paddings while keeping the header/nav visible
- Ensures brand usage follows the theme and style guide

## Global Navigation Links

Visible in the top navigation (desktop) and in the mobile menu (collapsed):
- Dashboard → /dashboard
- Profiles → /profiles
- Segments → /segments
- Messages → /messages
- Decisioning → /decisioning
- Settings → Account → /account

Logo and avatar shortcuts
- Logo click → /dashboard
- User avatar → /profile

Note: Accept Invite, Sign-in, Register, and other auth/utility pages are not part of the global nav links.

## Responsive Behavior

- Desktop and tablet (md and up)
  - The header shows logo, nav links, account switcher, and user avatar inline
- Mobile (sm and below)
  - The header shows logo, an account switcher button, and a hamburger expand button
  - The nav links and account controls collapse into a slide-down panel below the header
  - The expand button toggles aria-expanded and aria-controls for accessibility
- Fullscreen pages
  - The header and any nav chrome are hidden when useFullPage is active

## Structure and Classes

- Use the theme’s app-header for the top bar and container-page for content width/padding
- Use navlink and navlink active for navigation items
- Use btn and btn-icon for actions; brand color is reserved for interactive elements
- Use content-2col and right-rail for the main 2-column pattern (optional rail)
- Use rail-hidden to collapse the right rail for full-width primary content

## Account Switcher

- Shown in the header next to navigation
- Displays the current account name (and logo if available)
- Clicking opens a popover or panel listing the user’s accounts
- Selecting an account calls app().switchAccountAsync(accountId) and updates tenancy-scoped data
- Uses useUserInfo() or useAccount() to show current account; useFileUrl() to resolve logo image path when available

## Display Modes

- Fullscreen
  - useIsInFullPageMode() → true hides the header, leaving only children visible
  - Typical for authentication or wizard-like flows that request fullscreen with useFullPage()
- No Margins
  - useIsNoMarginMode() → true removes page margins/paddings for edge-to-edge views
  - Header remains visible

## Active Link Highlighting

- The current route should render its link with navlink active
- On mobile, the active link remains highlighted within the expanded panel

## Accessibility

- Hamburger button includes aria-label, aria-expanded, and aria-controls pointing to the mobile menu panel
- Account switcher button includes aria-haspopup="menu", aria-expanded, and proper keyboard handling
- Focus management and rings use the theme’s focus-ring utilities

## Implementation Notes

- Tech stack: React, Next.js (pages directory), Tailwind CSS v4, lucide-react, Supabase
- Static Site Generation only; do not use the Next.js App Router
- Pages export a default function and must not import MainLayout; MainLayout is applied by the App component
- Page root must include className "page--{PageComponentName}"
- Respect multi-tenant scoping with account_id; switching accounts via app().switchAccountAsync

## Header and Navigation Markup (JSX Example)

```tsx
import { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from "react";
import Link from "next/link";
import { Logo } from "@/components/Logo";
import { useIsInFullPageMode, useIsNoMarginMode, useUserInfo, useFileUrl } from "@/lib/hooks";
import { app } from "@/lib/app";
import { cn } from "@/lib/util";
import { ChevronDown, Menu, X } from "lucide-react";

interface MainLayoutProps {
    children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function MainLayout({ children }: MainLayoutProps) {
    const isFullscreen = useIsInFullPageMode();
    const noMargins = useIsNoMarginMode();
    const userInfo = useUserInfo();
    const account = userInfo?.account;
    const accountLogoUrl = useFileUrl(account?.logo_image_path);
    const [mobileOpen, setMobileOpen] = useState(false);
    const [acctOpen, setAcctOpen] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        if (isFullscreen) {
            setMobileOpen(false);
            setAcctOpen(false);
        }
    }, [isFullscreen]);

    const navLinks = useMemo(
        () => [
            { href: "/dashboard", label: "Dashboard" },
            { href: "/profiles", label: "Profiles" },
            { href: "/segments", label: "Segments" },
            { href: "/messages", label: "Messages" },
            { href: "/decisioning", label: "Decisioning" },
            { href: "/account", label: "Settings" },
        ],
        []
    );

        </div>
    );
}
```

Notes
- Use navlink active for the current route. This example omits the active state logic; integrate with your routing to add the active className.
- Replace ACCOUNT_ID_EXAMPLE in the switcher with real membership ids.
- Use useFileUrl for account logos; respect signed URLs and caching.

## Two-Column Content Pattern

- Use content-2col for a responsive 80:20 layout with a right rail
- Add rail-hidden to collapse into a single column

Example
```html
<section class="content-2col">
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <!-- Primary content -->
    </div>
    <aside class="right-rail space-y-3">
        <!-- Optional rail content -->
    </aside>
</section>
```

Collapse the rail
```html
<section class="content-2col rail-hidden">
    <div>Full-width primary content</div>
</section>
```

## Brand and Styling Guidance

- Follow the style guide: dark palette, neutral surfaces and borders, rounded corners, pill-shaped buttons
- Use brand color (var(--blue)) sparingly for interactive elements (buttons, links, icons)
- Use secondary color (var(--purple)) for non-interactive emphasis (alerts, badges)
- Use theme classes first (btn, card, navlink, highlight, container-page, content-2col) before ad-hoc utilities

## Integration With Pages

- Pages export default components and are mounted under MainLayout by the App component
- Pages can request:
  - Fullscreen via useFullPage()
  - No margins via useNoMargins()
- Pages should:
  - Include root className "page--{ComponentName}"
  - Use the theme’s components for consistency (card, tile, table, steps, etc.)

## Navigation Summary (for quick reference)

- Dashboard (/dashboard)
- Profiles (/profiles)
- Segments (/segments)
- Messages (/messages)
- Decisioning (/decisioning)
- Settings → Account (/account)

Shortcuts
- Logo → /dashboard
- Avatar → /profile

This layout ensures a modern, professional, dark-themed shell with a responsive top navigation, consistent two-column page composition, and account-aware multi-tenant behavior.

Generate a detailed description of the screen in markdown format. The description should not
    replicate functionally of the main-layout unless it is part of the main content of the screen.

    The description should include the following sections:
    - Name of screen
    - Description
    - The route of the screen
    - Actions: List of actions the user should be able to preform
    - Links: List of links to other routes. Should not include links in the main navigation of the app.

    Example:
    <example-screen-description>
    # Screen Description
    
    Name: {Name of screen}
    Route: {route}

    ## Description
    {Detailed Description}

    ## Actions
    {Bullet list of actions the user can preform on the screen}

    ## Links
    - profile: link to user profile
    - profile/[profileId]: link to public profile

# Screen Description

Name: Decisioning
Route: /decisioning

## Description
A dark-themed management screen that lists all AI decisioning agents for the current account (tenant). Users can quickly scan agent status, assigned segment, message category (content library), send schedule, and holdout configuration, then perform common actions such as creating, activating/deactivating, viewing details, or deleting an agent.

Layout and content
- Primary list: Displays agents in a compact table or grid of tiles with clear hover states.
- Each agent item shows:
  - Name and status (Active/Inactive)
  - Segment name (linked to segment detail)
  - Message category (linked to the category’s messages)
  - Frequency, days (Mon–Sun as compact chips), and time windows (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Holdout percentage
  - Created date; optional “last decisioned” timestamp if available
- Right rail (optional): Quick tips, governance reminders (e.g., “Messages are imported from GardenIQ — authoring is disabled”), and links to learn more about outcomes and attribution.
- Empty state: If no agents exist, display an informational card with a concise description and a primary CTA to create the first agent.

Permissions and behavior
- Admin, manager, and standard users can create, activate/deactivate, and delete agents; guests have view-only access (actions disabled).
- All data is account-scoped; only agents for the active account are displayed.
- Deleting requires confirmation to prevent accidental removal.

Styling and usability
- Modern, professional, dark palette with neutral surfaces and thin, subtle borders.
- Primary CTA “New Agent” uses brand color; secondary actions use neutral buttons.
- Status and schedule details are represented with badges/chips; non-interactive highlights use the secondary accent color.
- Avoid long button labels; favor icon buttons where appropriate (e.g., delete, activate toggle).

## Actions
- Create new agent (primary CTA; opens the three-step wizard)
- View agent details and decision log for a selected agent
- Activate or deactivate an agent via a status toggle
- Delete an agent (with confirmation)
- Optional list utilities:
  - Search by agent name (client-side)
  - Filter by status (Active/Inactive)
  - Sort by name or created date

## Links
- create-agent: opens the 3-step wizard to configure a new agent
- agent-detail: opens the selected agent’s decision log and summary
- segment-detail: view criteria and membership for the agent’s assigned segment
- message-category: browse the content library assigned to the agent
