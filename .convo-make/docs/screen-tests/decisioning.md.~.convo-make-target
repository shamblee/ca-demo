  - Role-based permissions
- App shell and layout
  - Global navigation with pages for Dashboard, Profiles, Segments, Messages, Decisioning, Settings
  - Two-column main content layout with an optional right rail
- Multi-tenant data model with Supabase
  - Account-centric tenancy
  - File storage using structured paths and signed URLs

## User Roles and Access

- App roles
  - guest: view-only permissions
  - default: standard account member; can edit content and configure agents
  - manager: default permissions plus can add/remove users
  - admin: all permissions; can change roles, manage billing, delete account

- Database roles (UserRole enum)
  - admin, standard, guest
  - Mapping guidance
    - guest (app) → guest (db)
    - default (app) → standard (db)
    - manager (app) → standard (db) plus manager capabilities handled by application logic/permissions checks
    - admin (app) → admin (db)

## Core Concepts and Relationships

- Profiles: stored customer contact records
- Enrichment: appends additional properties/attributes to profiles; creates Segments
- Segments: subsets of profiles based on demographics and/or event history
- Messages: imported content from GardenIQ; includes email, SMS, and push notification variants for a given subject
- Message categories: folders/content libraries that agents draw from
- Channels: the medium used for sending (email, SMS, push notification)
- AI decisioning agents: select message, channel, send day/time, and execute sends to profiles
- Agent settings: send frequency, time windows, desired outcomes, holdout percentage
- Outcomes: ranked as Worst, Good, Very Good, Best; events map to rankings
- Holdout percentage: portion of the segment excluded from agent sends for testing/control

## Global Navigation

- Left side pane navigation:
  - Home → Dashboard (/dashboard)
  - Profiles (/profiles)
  - Segments (/segments)
  - Messages (/messages)
  - Decisioning (/decisioning)
  - Settings → Account (/account)

## Main Layout

- Header bar with app logo (left) and user avatar (right)
  - Clicking the logo → Dashboard
  - Clicking the avatar → Profile (/profile)
- Two-column responsive content area (approx. 80:20)
  - Left: primary content
  - Right: optional secondary content (right rail)
  - Right rail can be hidden to allow full-width primary content

## Styling Guidelines

- Framework: Tailwind CSS (v4)
- Look and Feel
  - Modern, professional, dark palette
  - Neutral backgrounds and borders
  - Rounded corners; pill-shaped buttons
- Color palette
  - Brand: #4583F7 (var(--blue))
  - Secondary: #8E59FF (var(--purple))
- Usage rules
  - Use brand color sparingly for interactive elements (buttons, links, clickable icons)
  - Use thin brand-colored borders to highlight non-CTA elements when needed
  - Use secondary color to highlight non-interactive important information or as an accent
  - Both colors may be used with transparency for subtle shading and states

- Configuration
  - Segment assignment and holdout
  - Message category selection (content library)
  - Frequency controls (daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly), days, and time windows (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Outcome definitions with event mapping to Worst, Good, Very Good, Best
- Operation
  - Log every decision with timestamp, target profile, message, channel, scheduled send time, and concise reasoning
  - Respect holdout percentage for control groups
- Governance
  - Only use messages imported from GardenIQ; no authoring within the app

## Analytics and Attribution

- Web analytics: page views, new/unique sessions, form submissions
- Messaging: sends, opens, clicks, bounces, new subscribers, unsubscribers across all channels
- Ecommerce: add-to-cart, favorites/saves, initiated checkout, abandoned checkout, purchases
- Attribution and ROI
  - Revenue, orders, AOV attributed to messages and agents
  - Users can select messages or agents to analyze and compare

## Tech Stack and Architecture

- React, Next.js (pages directory), Tailwind CSS v4, lucide-react, Supabase, Zod, RxJS, uuid
- Static Site Generation (SSG) only; no server-side rendering (SSR)
- Pages live in /pages; do not use the Next.js App Router
- Exports: use named exports unless Next.js pages require default export
- Icons: lucide-react
- Forms: typed useState and Zod schemas for validation when persisting to DB

## Multi-Tenancy and Data

- Tenancy model
  - account table represents a tenant
  - All tenant-bound entities include account_id
  - Users link to accounts via account_membership
- Required base entities
  - User (id, created_at, name, email, profile_image_path?, hero_image_path?)
  - Account (id, created_at, name, logo_image_path?, hero_image_path?)
  - AccountMembership (id, created_at, last_accessed_at, user_id, account_id, role: user_role)
  - UserRole enum: admin, standard, guest
- Domain entities (conceptual)
  - Profile, Segment, Message, MessageCategory, Agent, AgentDecision, OutcomeMapping, ChannelSubscription
  - Ensure each has account_id for scoping
- File storage
  - Supabase Storage bucket: accounts
  - Path pattern: {account_id}/users/{user_id}/{REST_OF_PATH}
  - Store only the path in DB; resolve full URLs client-side with fileStore() or useFileUrl
- CRUD and data access
  - store() service and useStore*() hooks for reactive CRUD and querying
  - SelectOptions for pagination and ordering

## Layout and Page Conventions

- Main layout
  - Navigation bar and centered column content by default
  - Two-column content area with optional right rail
- Display modes
  - useFullPage() to hide main navigation and present a full-screen experience
  - useNoMargins() to remove margins and allow edge-to-edge designs
  - useIsInFullPageMode() and useIsNoMarginMode() to read current display state
- Pages
  - Next.js pages must export a default function named after the page
  - Root element className must follow: page--{PageComponentName}
  - Do not wrap pages with MainLayout directly; the App component handles it

## Authentication and Registration

- Authentication
  - Sign-in with email/password
  - If a user visits protected pages without being signed in, show SignInRequired
- Registration
  - When registering, store the user’s name and account name in options.data:
    - { name, accountName }
  - Do not insert DB rows explicitly during signup; backend handles user and account setup
- Invites
  - Accept via /accept-account-invite/[invite-code]
  - If not signed in, prompt to sign in first

## Permissions and Security

- Role-based access
  - Admin: full control, can edit account info, manage roles (except cannot change own role), billing, delete account
  - Manager: can add/remove users (handled by app logic), inherits standard permissions
  - Default/Standard: can edit content and configure agents
  - Guest: view-only
- Data isolation
  - All queries and mutations constrained by account_id

## Standard Components

- Logo
  - SVG logo, customizable color and size
  - import { Logo } from "@/components/Logo";
- SignInRequired
  - Card for access-restricted scenarios with sign-in/register links
  - import { SignInRequired } from "@/components/SignInRequired";

## Supabase, Hooks, and Utilities

- Supabase client
  - supClient() for auth and data operations
- Store service and hooks
  - store().select*/insert/update/delete
  - useStoreItem(), useStoreMatchingItems(), useStoreFirstMatchingItem()
- File utilities
  - fileStore().getUrlAsync(path), getCachedUrl(path)
  - useFileUrl(path)
- User/account hooks
  - useCurrentUser(), useAccount(), useUserRole(), useUserInfo()
- App controller
  - app().switchAccountAsync(accountId) to change active tenant
- Utilities
  - cn(...) to combine class names

## Interaction and UI Patterns

- Buttons and CTAs
  - Pill-shaped, no static widths, use brand color for primary interactions
- Links and icons
  - Use brand color sparingly; lucide-react icons for clarity with minimal visual noise
- States and emphasis
  - Secondary color used for non-interactive emphasis; transparent tints for subtle backgrounds and borders
- Thumbnails and lists
  - Compact grid cards with rounded corners, neutral borders, and clear hover states
- Modals and popovers
  - For rename, move, duplicate, and delete actions within message categories

## Glossary

- Profile: A customer record with contact info, attributes, and events
- Segment: A subset of profiles based on shared demographics or behavior
- Message: A marketing communication with variants (email, SMS, push)
- Category: A folder that organizes messages
- Agent: An automated decisioning entity that selects message, channel, and send timing
- Outcome: Event-to-ranking mapping guiding agent optimization
- Holdout: Percentage of a segment withheld from agent sends for control and measurement

# Screen Description

Name: Decisioning
Route: /decisioning

## Description
A dark-themed management screen that lists all AI decisioning agents for the current account (tenant). Users can quickly scan agent status, assigned segment, message category (content library), send schedule, and holdout configuration, then perform common actions such as creating, activating/deactivating, viewing details, or deleting an agent.

Layout and content
- Primary list: Displays agents in a compact table or grid of tiles with clear hover states.
- Each agent item shows:
  - Name and status (Active/Inactive)
  - Segment name (linked to segment detail)
  - Message category (linked to the category’s messages)
  - Frequency, days (Mon–Sun as compact chips), and time windows (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Holdout percentage
  - Created date; optional “last decisioned” timestamp if available
- Right rail (optional): Quick tips, governance reminders (e.g., “Messages are imported from GardenIQ — authoring is disabled”), and links to learn more about outcomes and attribution.
- Empty state: If no agents exist, display an informational card with a concise description and a primary CTA to create the first agent.

Permissions and behavior
- Admin, manager, and standard users can create, activate/deactivate, and delete agents; guests have view-only access (actions disabled).
- All data is account-scoped; only agents for the active account are displayed.
- Deleting requires confirmation to prevent accidental removal.

Styling and usability
- Modern, professional, dark palette with neutral surfaces and thin, subtle borders.
- Primary CTA “New Agent” uses brand color; secondary actions use neutral buttons.
- Status and schedule details are represented with badges/chips; non-interactive highlights use the secondary accent color.
- Avoid long button labels; favor icon buttons where appropriate (e.g., delete, activate toggle).

## Actions
- Create new agent (primary CTA; opens the three-step wizard)
- View agent details and decision log for a selected agent
- Activate or deactivate an agent via a status toggle
- Delete an agent (with confirmation)
- Optional list utilities:
  - Search by agent name (client-side)
  - Filter by status (Active/Inactive)
  - Sort by name or created date

## Links
- create-agent: opens the 3-step wizard to configure a new agent
- agent-detail: opens the selected agent’s decision log and summary
- segment-detail: view criteria and membership for the agent’s assigned segment
- message-category: browse the content library assigned to the agent

- Open /decisioning and confirm the dark-themed list of agents is visible with an optional right rail.
- (If no agents exist) Verify the empty state card explains agents and shows a primary “Create your first agent” CTA.
- Click “New Agent” and confirm it navigates to /create-agent; return to /decisioning.
- For a visible agent, verify the item shows: name, status badge, segment link, message category link, frequency, day chips, time window chips, holdout %, created date, and (if present) last decisioned timestamp.
- Click the segment name and confirm navigation to /segment-detail for that segment; go back.
- Click the message category and confirm navigation to /message-category; go back.
- Open the agent’s detail (by clicking its name or a details control) and confirm /agent-detail loads; go back.
- Use the status filter to show Active only; verify the list updates; clear the filter.
- Use the search box to find an agent by partial name; clear search to restore the full list.
- Sort by Created date and confirm the order changes as expected.
- Toggle an agent from Active to Inactive; verify the status badge updates; refresh the page to confirm it persists; toggle back to Active.
- Open the delete action for an agent and verify a confirmation modal appears; choose Cancel to keep the agent.
- (Optional) If you have a disposable agent, confirm deletion and verify it is removed from the list.
- Hover an agent row/tile and confirm a subtle hover state and the presence of icon buttons for actions.
- Verify the right rail shows a governance reminder that messages are imported from GardenIQ (authoring disabled) and links to learn about outcomes/attribution.
- (Optional) Switch to another account and confirm the agent list reflects only that account’s agents; switch back.
- (Optional) Sign in as a guest user (or impersonate) and verify New Agent, activate/deactivate, and delete actions are disabled, while links (agent detail, segment, category) remain navigable.
