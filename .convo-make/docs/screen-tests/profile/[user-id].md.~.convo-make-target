  - Role-based permissions
- App shell and layout
  - Global navigation with pages for Dashboard, Profiles, Segments, Messages, Decisioning, Settings
  - Two-column main content layout with an optional right rail
- Multi-tenant data model with Supabase
  - Account-centric tenancy
  - File storage using structured paths and signed URLs

## User Roles and Access

- App roles
  - guest: view-only permissions
  - default: standard account member; can edit content and configure agents
  - manager: default permissions plus can add/remove users
  - admin: all permissions; can change roles, manage billing, delete account

- Database roles (UserRole enum)
  - admin, standard, guest
  - Mapping guidance
    - guest (app) → guest (db)
    - default (app) → standard (db)
    - manager (app) → standard (db) plus manager capabilities handled by application logic/permissions checks
    - admin (app) → admin (db)

## Core Concepts and Relationships

- Profiles: stored customer contact records
- Enrichment: appends additional properties/attributes to profiles; creates Segments
- Segments: subsets of profiles based on demographics and/or event history
- Messages: imported content from GardenIQ; includes email, SMS, and push notification variants for a given subject
- Message categories: folders/content libraries that agents draw from
- Channels: the medium used for sending (email, SMS, push notification)
- AI decisioning agents: select message, channel, send day/time, and execute sends to profiles
- Agent settings: send frequency, time windows, desired outcomes, holdout percentage
- Outcomes: ranked as Worst, Good, Very Good, Best; events map to rankings
- Holdout percentage: portion of the segment excluded from agent sends for testing/control

## Global Navigation

- Left side pane navigation:
  - Home → Dashboard (/dashboard)
  - Profiles (/profiles)
  - Segments (/segments)
  - Messages (/messages)
  - Decisioning (/decisioning)
  - Settings → Account (/account)

## Main Layout

- Header bar with app logo (left) and user avatar (right)
  - Clicking the logo → Dashboard
  - Clicking the avatar → Profile (/profile)
- Two-column responsive content area (approx. 80:20)
  - Left: primary content
  - Right: optional secondary content (right rail)
  - Right rail can be hidden to allow full-width primary content

## Styling Guidelines

- Framework: Tailwind CSS (v4)
- Look and Feel
  - Modern, professional, dark palette
  - Neutral backgrounds and borders
  - Rounded corners; pill-shaped buttons
- Color palette
  - Brand: #4583F7 (var(--blue))
  - Secondary: #8E59FF (var(--purple))
- Usage rules
  - Use brand color sparingly for interactive elements (buttons, links, clickable icons)
  - Use thin brand-colored borders to highlight non-CTA elements when needed
  - Use secondary color to highlight non-interactive important information or as an accent
  - Both colors may be used with transparency for subtle shading and states

  - Message category selection (content library)
  - Frequency controls (daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly), days, and time windows (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Outcome definitions with event mapping to Worst, Good, Very Good, Best
- Operation
  - Log every decision with timestamp, target profile, message, channel, scheduled send time, and concise reasoning
  - Respect holdout percentage for control groups
- Governance
  - Only use messages imported from GardenIQ; no authoring within the app

## Analytics and Attribution

- Web analytics: page views, new/unique sessions, form submissions
- Messaging: sends, opens, clicks, bounces, new subscribers, unsubscribers across all channels
- Ecommerce: add-to-cart, favorites/saves, initiated checkout, abandoned checkout, purchases
- Attribution and ROI
  - Revenue, orders, AOV attributed to messages and agents
  - Users can select messages or agents to analyze and compare

## Tech Stack and Architecture

- React, Next.js (pages directory), Tailwind CSS v4, lucide-react, Supabase, Zod, RxJS, uuid
- Static Site Generation (SSG) only; no server-side rendering (SSR)
- Pages live in /pages; do not use the Next.js App Router
- Exports: use named exports unless Next.js pages require default export
- Icons: lucide-react
- Forms: typed useState and Zod schemas for validation when persisting to DB

## Multi-Tenancy and Data

- Tenancy model
  - account table represents a tenant
  - All tenant-bound entities include account_id
  - Users link to accounts via account_membership
- Required base entities
  - User (id, created_at, name, email, profile_image_path?, hero_image_path?)
  - Account (id, created_at, name, logo_image_path?, hero_image_path?)
  - AccountMembership (id, created_at, last_accessed_at, user_id, account_id, role: user_role)
  - UserRole enum: admin, standard, guest
- Domain entities (conceptual)
  - Profile, Segment, Message, MessageCategory, Agent, AgentDecision, OutcomeMapping, ChannelSubscription
  - Ensure each has account_id for scoping
- File storage
  - Supabase Storage bucket: accounts
  - Path pattern: {account_id}/users/{user_id}/{REST_OF_PATH}
  - Store only the path in DB; resolve full URLs client-side with fileStore() or useFileUrl
- CRUD and data access
  - store() service and useStore*() hooks for reactive CRUD and querying
  - SelectOptions for pagination and ordering

## Layout and Page Conventions

- Main layout
  - Navigation bar and centered column content by default
  - Two-column content area with optional right rail
- Display modes
  - useFullPage() to hide main navigation and present a full-screen experience
  - useNoMargins() to remove margins and allow edge-to-edge designs
  - useIsInFullPageMode() and useIsNoMarginMode() to read current display state
- Pages
  - Next.js pages must export a default function named after the page
  - Root element className must follow: page--{PageComponentName}
  - Do not wrap pages with MainLayout directly; the App component handles it

## Authentication and Registration

- Authentication
  - Sign-in with email/password
  - If a user visits protected pages without being signed in, show SignInRequired
- Registration
  - When registering, store the user’s name and account name in options.data:
    - { name, accountName }
  - Do not insert DB rows explicitly during signup; backend handles user and account setup
- Invites
  - Accept via /accept-account-invite/[invite-code]
  - If not signed in, prompt to sign in first

## Permissions and Security

- Role-based access
  - Admin: full control, can edit account info, manage roles (except cannot change own role), billing, delete account
  - Manager: can add/remove users (handled by app logic), inherits standard permissions
  - Default/Standard: can edit content and configure agents
  - Guest: view-only
- Data isolation
  - All queries and mutations constrained by account_id

## Standard Components

- Logo
  - SVG logo, customizable color and size
  - import { Logo } from "@/components/Logo";
- SignInRequired
  - Card for access-restricted scenarios with sign-in/register links
  - import { SignInRequired } from "@/components/SignInRequired";

## Supabase, Hooks, and Utilities

- Supabase client
  - supClient() for auth and data operations
- Store service and hooks
  - store().select*/insert/update/delete
  - useStoreItem(), useStoreMatchingItems(), useStoreFirstMatchingItem()
- File utilities
  - fileStore().getUrlAsync(path), getCachedUrl(path)
  - useFileUrl(path)
- User/account hooks
  - useCurrentUser(), useAccount(), useUserRole(), useUserInfo()
- App controller
  - app().switchAccountAsync(accountId) to change active tenant
- Utilities
  - cn(...) to combine class names

## Interaction and UI Patterns

- Buttons and CTAs
  - Pill-shaped, no static widths, use brand color for primary interactions
- Links and icons
  - Use brand color sparingly; lucide-react icons for clarity with minimal visual noise
- States and emphasis
  - Secondary color used for non-interactive emphasis; transparent tints for subtle backgrounds and borders
- Thumbnails and lists
  - Compact grid cards with rounded corners, neutral borders, and clear hover states
- Modals and popovers
  - For rename, move, duplicate, and delete actions within message categories

## Glossary

- Profile: A customer record with contact info, attributes, and events
- Segment: A subset of profiles based on shared demographics or behavior
- Message: A marketing communication with variants (email, SMS, push)
- Category: A folder that organizes messages
- Agent: An automated decisioning entity that selects message, channel, and send timing
- Outcome: Event-to-ranking mapping guiding agent optimization
- Holdout: Percentage of a segment withheld from agent sends for control and measurement

# Screen Description

Name: Public Profile
Route: /profile/[user-id]

## Description
Public, account-scoped view of another user’s profile. This page surfaces the user’s basic identity details alongside their membership information for the current account. All signed-in users can view the user’s name, email, avatar/hero (if present), and metadata such as user id and when the user record was created. When the viewer is an account admin, a Role card appears in the right rail enabling role changes for the viewed user within the current account.

Behavior and permissions
- View state (all signed-in users): read-only details for the user in the context of the active account.
- Admin control: a Role selector shows “Admin”, “Standard”, and “Guest” (mapped to the user_role enum). Saving updates the account_membership role for this user in the current account only.
- Safeguards:
  - Admins cannot change their own role from this page (the control is disabled with a helpful message).
  - If the viewed user has no membership in the current account (edge case), the page shows basic info and a muted notice that membership is required to manage roles.
- Layout guidance:
  - Primary column: identity block (avatar, name, email), user metadata (id, created_at), and optional hero banner preview.
  - Right rail (when space allows): Role management card (admin-only), quick copy actions, and a permanent link (copy profile URL).
- Multi-tenant scoping: all data and actions are constrained to the current account_id; only the membership in the active account is editable.

Primary content blocks
- Identity: avatar, name, email (read-only), optional hero image preview.
- Metadata: user id (copyable), created_at, last accessed at (from account_membership when available).
- Role (admin-only): current role, selector for admin/standard/guest, Save and Cancel controls, disabled state for self-role.

States and feedback
- Success and error toasts on role updates.
- Disabled controls when the viewer lacks admin permissions.
- Skeleton/loading states while user or membership loads.
- Muted alert if the user is not a member of the current account (no role to display).

## Actions
- View public user information (avatar, name, email)
- View account-scoped metadata (role, last accessed, created date; where available)
- Copy user id
- Copy email address
- Copy permalink to this public profile
- Admin: Change this user’s role within the current account (Admin, Standard, Guest)
- Admin: Save role changes
- Admin: Cancel/revert unsaved role changes

## Links
- profile: link to your personal profile (/profile)
- profile/[user-id]: copyable permalink to this public profile page
